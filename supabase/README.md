# Supabase Operations

This folder stores artifacts created by the Supabase CLI for the `supabase-buzzttara` project.

## Quick Commands
- `supabase link --project-ref supabase-buzzttara`
- `supabase db pull` to mirror production into local migrations
- `supabase migration new <name>` to scaffold a change
- `supabase db push` to apply local migrations to the linked project

## Structure
- `migrations/` – CLI-generated migration files checked into git
- `seed.sql` or `seeds/` – optional deterministic data for local/dev usage

> **Note:** `supabase/config.toml` is generated by the CLI, contains project refs/keys, and is intentionally gitignored.
