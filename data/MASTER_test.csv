MAZE is a four-member hybrid idol × band unit formed in Tokyo in 2022 under YKUN NEON ENTERTAINMENT. Built by ex-miscast staff and members, they perform both “idol-set” shows and full band-set concerts.

Their sound fuses bright J-pop hooks with loud rock / electronicore / metalcore elements—screams and clean vocals over breakdowns and EDM-leaning drops. Recent releases and collabs include “IDOL RIOT” (feat. Daisuke of SEVER BLACK PARANOIA), “SUPERSONIC,” and “I miss in my life” (feat. PABLO), reflecting the group’s heavy, live-ready orientation and choreographed intensity. 

Recent overseas activity (as of Oct 2025).

BABYTANTS is a Tokyo twin rock-idol duo that debuted on Feb 19, 2024. The members—older sister Rakuu and younger sister Kyuu—self-produce: they write lyrics and music, arrange, and choreograph their shows. Their stated goal is to reach Nippon Budokan by 2029; fans are nicknamed “Moony Man.” Recent milestones include a 1st-anniversary one-man at Shinjuku MARZ (Feb 18, 2025) and a 1.5-anniversary full band one-man at Shibuya WWW (Aug 4, 2025). 

Musical style.
Guitar-driven, high-energy rock × idol with twin harmonies and shout-along hooks; the duo leans on anthemic tempos and simple, sweat-soaked choreography designed for compact live houses and festival stages alike. (Their “self-made” workflow is a core identity.) 

Recent overseas activity.
As of Nov 2025, BABYTANTS’ official feeds and schedules list domestic shows only; no official overseas dates have been announced.
